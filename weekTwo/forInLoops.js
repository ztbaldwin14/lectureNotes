 FOR IN LOOPS
************
    - For In Loops count the enumerable properties in an object.
    - Objects contain what are known as enumerable properties - which just means countable. So although properties in an object don't contain an index like arrays, their properties can be simply counted. 

    - a key - so think a key in an object - goes IN to a lock for it to correctly work and unlock. So for in loops are best used with objects, and that means for of loops are best used with arrays

/* BRONZE

    - Using a for in loop, console.log the name of each character from the members key in the fellowshipOfTheRing object.

*/

/* SILVER

    - Add a conditional to the for in loop that checks if the characters name does not begin with a vowel. Then, using string interpolation, console.log either '__'s name does not begin with a vowel' or '__'s name does begin with a vowel'.

*/

/* GOLD

    - Declare a globally scoped variable of arr that is initialized as an empty array. If the characters name does not begin with a vowel, add that character to the new array, and then console.log the array.
